# Optimal wind farm cable routing Modeling branches and offshore transformer modules 
This Jupyter notebook contains an implementation of an example shown in "Optimal wind farm cable routing: Modeling branches and offshore transformer modules" paper [Optimal wind farm cable routing: Modeling branches and offshore transformer modules](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/net.21804).

This article shows the optimization of cable connections between turbines in an offshore wind park. There are many model that article shows you but in this notebook I implemented only the first model named OWFCR.
